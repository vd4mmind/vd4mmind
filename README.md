👋 Hi, I’m @ivivek87 from X https://twitter.com/ivivek87 

- 👀 I work on finding therapeutics or biomarkers for multiple cardiometabolomic (e.g. Chronic Kidney, Athersclerosis, Liver, etc.) diseases in a data driven manner leveraging the integreation of bulk and single cell multi-omics data alongside clinical data from observational cohorts

- 🌱 I currently collaborate and on single-cell transcriptomcis, spatial transcriptomics, multi-omics data integration, climical data integration to achieve the above

- 💞️ I also collaborate on developing applied machine learning models with curious students or researchers and contribute to open science and open source modeling. I am fascinated by high-dimnesional and high-throughput data.

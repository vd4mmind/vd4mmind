👋 Hi, I’m Vivek Das and you can fine me at: **X** https://twitter.com/ivivek87 or in **LinkedIn** https://www.linkedin.com/in/vivek-das-phd-m-sc-b1110b25/

- 👀 I work on finding therapeutic target or biomarkers for multiple cardiometabolomic (e.g. Chronic Kidney, Athersclerosis, Liver, etc.) diseases in a data driven manner leveraging the integreation of bulk and single cell multi-omics data alongside clinical data from human observational cohorts

- 🌱 I currently collaborate on studies or projects involving single-cell transcriptomcis, spatial transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, multi-omics data integration, clinical data integration to achieve the above

- 💻 I work on omics projects involving preclinical data with interventional designs e.g. knockout or drug treated at single cell or bulk multi-omics level

- 💞️ I also collaborate on developing applied machine learning models with curious students or researchers and contribute to open science and open source modeling. I am fascinated by high-dimnesional and high-throughput data.
